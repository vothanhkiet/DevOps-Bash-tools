usage_description="
In a forked GitHub repo's checkout, determines the origin of the fork using GitHub CLI,
configures a git remote to the upstream, pulls the default branch and if on a branch other than the default
then merges the default branch to the local current branch

Simplifies and automates keeping your personal forked repo up to date with the upstream to resolve merge conflicts
locally and submit updated Pull Requests

Set environment variable GIT_REBASE=true if you want the pulls and merge to current branch to rebase instead of merge commit...
if you really love violating VCS history integrity! Personally, not a fan. You can also end up in rebase hell for a series of
commits that a default merge commit would have auto-resolved

Read:

    https://github.com/HariSekhon/Knowledge-Base/blob/main/git.md#the-evils-of-rebasing

Requires GitHub CLI to be installed and authenticated, as well as jq
