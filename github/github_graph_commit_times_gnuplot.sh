usage_description="
Generates a GNUplot graph of Git commit times from all GitHub repos for a given user using the GitHub API

Generates the following files:

    $code - Code

    $data     - Data

    $image     - Image

A MermaidJS version of this program is adjacent in:

    github_graph_commit_times_mermaidjs.sh

A Golang version of this program can be found here:

    https://github.com/HariSekhon/GitHub-Graph-Commit-Times

Fetching GitHub commits via the API is slow so if \$CACHE_GITHUB_COMMITS is set will cache the data locally and not
re-fetch it on subsequent runs (useful for tweaking the graph and just re-running quickly)

Requires GitHub CLI and GNUplot to be installed and GH_TOKEN to be present
