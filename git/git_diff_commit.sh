usage_description="
Quickly commits added or updated files to Git, showing a diff and easily enter prompt for each file

Commits with a generic \"added \$filename\" or \"updated \$filename\" commit message

Lazy but awesome for lots of daily quick intermediate commit saves

Originally used in .bash.d/git.sh as a function git() and vimrc hotkey

Ported to external script be callable from IntelliJ as an External Tool because it's less keystrokes
and no mouse movement compared to IntelliJ's own hot key git commit tooling

If no args are given, then git diffs and commits against the current working directory
